SuperJer Notes Index ~

Check out what we have for |breakfast|, it looks delicious!

Well here are my notes. The best thing about notes is how they won't leave you
to die in the middle of the street after breakfast.

OK so let's say I'm writing a {really long} line that might just go on for a
verrrrry, extremely, super-duper long and here's some more! Ah waaaan time I
was a cobra Doughty! Now what the heck is goin on here? What do you think OK
when you do it, you gotta do it about that? An new sentence goes here, for what
it is worth! What if I go back and list these? 'wordiskisk'

	1. What?
	2. What what? What the what in the heck is going on with this crazy
	   nonsensical garbage? Seriously.
	3. Now what?
	4. OK does it work now? I really do hope so. But I'm willing to live
	   without it if I have to!
	5. Ok let's do this. Now what?
	6. That's what!

	1. Roses are rose,
	2. Roses are blue,
	3. Roses are you,
	4. Be at my place at ten.
	5. What the hell do you want, when the hell do you want it, and why the 
	   hell would you even want it in the first place?
	6. Keep outta my shit!!
	7. Well that's one way!

And make lots of crazy changes to this whole paragraph? Will the formatting be
east to fix or will it be a nightmare? This paragraph is where we are all at! 
I'm not reall so sure, are you?  Are you, you little monkey?

Is that all that takes? >

     Is this really it?

I guess that's it!
