REQUIRED LIBRARIES:
-------------------
   libSDL1.2-dev
   libSDL-net1.2-dev
   libSDL-image1.2-dev
   glew


How to build:
-------------
   The following explains briefly how to build for Linux,
   Win32 or Mac with GNU GCC and GNU Make. You may need to
   edit the relevant Makefile to match your paths.


   Build for Linux:
   ----------------
   1. Make sure you have the above libraries installed
   2. Run `make`
      - this will create the executable `spartor_linux`


   Build for Win32:
   ----------------
   1. Install msysGit
      - http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
   2. Compile and install libSDL, libSDL-net and libSDL-image
      - http://www.libsdl.org/
   3. Run `make -f Makefile.win32`
      - this will create the executable `spartor_win32.exe`


   Build for Mac:
   --------------
   1. Install MacPorts
      - http://www.macports.org/
   2. Run `sudo port selfupdate`
   3. Run `sudo port install glew`
   4. The required SDL dev packages for Mac are included with
      this source so you shouldn't need to get them yourself.
   5. Run `make -f Makefile.mac`
      - this will create the executable `spartor_mac` and
        place it in ./spartor_mac.app/Contents/MacOS
