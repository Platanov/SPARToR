REQUIRED LIBRARIES:
-------------------
   libSDL1.2-dev
   libSDL-net1.2-dev
   libSDL-image1.2-dev


How to build:
-------------
   The following explains briefly how to build for Linux,
   Win32 or Mac with GNU GCC and GNU Make. You may need to
   edit the relevant Makefile to match your paths.


   Build on Linux:
   ---------------
   1. Make sure you have the above libraries installed
   2. Run `make`
      - this will create the executable `spartor_linux`


   Build for Win32 on Linux:
   -------------------------
   1. Install MinGW cross-compiler
      - there is a nice script called mingw-builder for this
   2. Install the SDL win32 dev libs into your cross-compiler
      - i.e. into ~/mingw32/lib, ~/mingw32/include
   3. Run `make -f Makewin32`
      - this will create the executable `spartor_win32.exe`


   Build on Mac:
   -------------
   1. Install 'frameworks' for the above libraries
   2. For some reason on Mac, the SDL net and image headers
      are NOT in SDL/...
      - so mkdir SDL and copy them there I guess
   3. Run `make -f Makemac`
      - this will create the executable `spartor_mac`
